    "​Garima Malik began their professional artistic journey in Fine Arts from the Delhi Collage of Arts where I earned my qualification in Super Professional Diploma. Being a literature student helps a lot in defining art. Art is similar to poetry. Painting and poetry are similar in the way that they make “absent things present",
